# Task 2: 
Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss matrix norms. Look for sites that explain induced matrix norms. Write a brief summary of what you find. Limit the discussion to no more than two or three paragraphs and include links to the sites you cite. 
# Proof
According to the article on wikipedia [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm) there's not much difference between a vector norm and a matrix norm, as the matrix norm is just the vector norm applied in sequence but only for the very special 1,2 and infinity norms. The 1 matrix norm is the maximum absolute column sum,  The infinty matrix norm is the maximum absolute row sum. This is backed up the the same sentiment from wolfram mathworld [link](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixNorm.html). A more general approach talks about their required properties of positivity, homogeneity, and the that they satisfy the triangle inequality can be found at [link](http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/algebra/node12.html), it also expounds on the 2 norm AKA the forbenius norm, but more on that later. This article goes on with proofs that for any matrix norm for any value p the norm will have the 5(3 main and 2 extra) properties of a matrix norm. There is also proofs for the 1 norm being the absolute column sum and that the infinty norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
