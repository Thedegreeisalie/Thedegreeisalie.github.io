# Task 9:
 Task: Do an internet search for pages that discuss the difference between the solution of the least squares problem using the normal equations and the solution via QR factorization of the matrix. Make sure that you cite the sites you use and include a couple of paragraphs in your own words. 

# Proof
 [link](https://www.math.uci.edu/~chenlong/RNLA/LSQRSVD.pdf) illistrates the use of modified Gram-Schmidt to gain a more numerically stable Matrix Q. The original Q from the regular old QR decomposion is not stable because GS is not stable, there's the chance that because of roundoff one or two columns may be very close to dependant on eachother. As a second method using householder transformations to preserve the orthogonality of Q and form the normal vector. The third method the article presents is the use fo SVD factorization to solve for x, the author goes into detail about the geometric interpetation of the SVD, saying that it is just a scaling of the axis vectors. The author mentions that this approach works for tall(rectangluar) matrices. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) has a more friendly version of householder transformations, and seconds the numeric instability of the GS algorithm. It does highlight that the Householder reflection is not easily parallelized and is bandwith heavy. The article details anothe type of transformation the Givens rotation which is more easily prallelized, but it's implementation is much more involved. [link](http://www.math.iit.edu/~fass/477577_Chapter_4.pdf) Details a discussion of the numerical instability of the GS algorithm, and the modified GS algorithm. The article concludes that householder reflections work better than either GS method.
