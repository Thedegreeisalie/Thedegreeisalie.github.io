# Task 10
 Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss linear algebra packages for solving linear algebra problems. Find a couple of sites that most closely line up with what you think we will be doing in the class. Reference the sites in a brief discussion. 

# Proof
LAPACK [link](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) Was written in fortan 90, It's the very first one that google will suggest. The wikipedia page [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK) mentions a number of the algorithms that were implemented in class. QR, LU, and Cholesky for example.
SciPy [link](https://www.scipy.org/) Is written in python, includes some subpackages that are almost infamous(NumPy, matplotlib, etc.). 
Dlib [link](http://dlib.net/) Written in c++, includes a large number of packages that aren't strictly for Linear Algebra (Networking, ML, Imageprocessing, etc). It appears to contain the same methods that are descibed above in LAPACK
