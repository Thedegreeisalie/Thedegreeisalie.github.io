Repeat the ideas in class of creating a shared library with the machine epsilon routines included in the library. Then include the absolute and relative error routines you created and documented in teh sofware manual for the course. At this point, you should have a total of 4 routines in your shared library at theis point in the course. I fyou have not wirtten the two machine epsilon codes, do that as part of this task. 

**Compile Steps:**   

	cd lib/
	g++ *.cpp
	ar rcvf mylib.a *.o
