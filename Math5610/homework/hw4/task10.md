# Task 1:
task: Search the internet for sites that discuss parallel algorithms for matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication. Summarize in a paragraph or two and as always, cite your sites.
# Proof

[link](http://www.hpcc.unn.ru/mskurs/ENG/DOC/pp07.pdf) is an indepth look at matrix vector multiplicaiton. It beaks up matrix vector multiplication into three schemes(Rows, Columns, Chessboard) and then shows the difference in speed up across 2, 4 and then 8 processors. The greatest speed up experimentally obtained seemed to the for the row wise parition. Though it doesn't immedately appear that any one scheme is computationally more effient than the other as the same number of opperations must be done. [link](https://www3.nd.edu/~zxu2/acms60212-40212/Lec-07-2.pdf) goes indepth about the communication needed between processors for a column wise scheme just like described in the first article, it even references MPI methods for communication between processors. Wikipedia [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm) has a summary of the Chessboard scheme and expounds the case of the non-square matrices. It seems that the major slowdown for a parallel algorithm is not the actual computation but instead the communication between processes is the largest bottleneck in terms of performance.
