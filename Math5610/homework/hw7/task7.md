# Task 7:
Task: Do an internet search on the use of iterative methods for the solution of linear systems of equations. Provide a list of at least three methods that do not use preconditioning of the system
# Proof
[link](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis515/cis515-12-sl5.pdf) describes Jacobi, Gauss-siedel and Relaxation methods none of which mention preconditioning. Jacobi does assume that all diagonal entries are nonzero, which can be the result of a preconditioning scheme. Jacobi forms a matrix J = D^-1(E+F) then uses this to compute subsequent interations to solve Dx_{k+1} =  (E+F)x_{k} + b. This method can be altered to form the Gauss-Siedel iteratve method x_{k+1} =(D=E)^-1Fu_k + (D-E)^-1b, where  B=(D=E)^-1Fu_k is called the matrix of Gauss-Seidel. Gauss-Seidel has the virtue of being much more memory effient, only needing half the memory that Jacobi uses. The relaxation method uses a strange relaxation parameter. The article expounds on the convergence of all three methods.
