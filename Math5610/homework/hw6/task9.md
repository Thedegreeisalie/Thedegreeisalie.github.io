# Task 9:
 Task: Do an internet search for pages that discuss the difference between the solution of the least squares problem using the normal equations and the solution via QR factorization of the matrix. Make sure that you cite the sites you use and include a couple of paragraphs in your own words. 

# Proof
[link](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/133A/lectures/ls.pdf) details the problem of least squares using the normal equations and the Gram matrix. The slides detail that problems may arise when forming the gram matrix A^T.A, but the same problems will not appear in the case of QR factorizaion. The specific example in these slides illistrates that after rounding, the Gram matrix could be singular meaning the method fails. [link](http://www.math.kent.edu/~reichel/courses/intr.num.comp.1/fall09/lecture4/lecture4.pdf) describes in more detail the weakness of the normal equations. They are more prone to Errors inthe data and have a greater sensitivity to roundoff errors introduced during computation. The article expounds that the condition number of the intal matrix A will be the root of the matrix A^T.A that is used in the normal equations, meaning for a poorly conditioned A the normal equations solution will use a conditioning number squared the already poor conditioning. The author states clearly that solving the least squares problem using the normal equations is a bad idea for systems with poorly conditioned A. [link](https://www.math.uci.edu/~chenlong/RNLA/LSQRSVD.pdf) declares that QR is much fore stable is is the algorithm that is used the most, even though it is somewhat computationally expensive.
